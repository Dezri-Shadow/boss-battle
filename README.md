# boss-battle

When I started this project a year ago I didn't know how to use GitHub so I just threw 
files up on the server through the web portal. For anyone who knows how to use GitHub, 
I can see the cringe. Now I know more about how to use Git and GitHub so I'm redo-ing
the repo so that the commits will make sense and people can see the project more 
completely.

This project was intended to be a game to showcase the things I had been learning in Vue
a year ago when I started it. I kinda gave up on Vue since the community for it is small
compared to other JS frameworks, and learning Vue while fun was not going to push my career
where I wanted it to go. I may come back to it at some point, but for right now I'm just 
getting my Git house in order.

The actual game was intended to be a sort of backwards battle RPG. So many phone games put
emphasis on leveling up and beating harder bosses, but I have seen people do crazy things
with underleveled or underequipped characters. I wanted to make a game that rewarded that
playstyle explicitly. Hence the idea for Boss-Battle. You can level your character as much
as you want, but you get more achievement points for beating the boss at a lower level.

Most of what you see here is just a test level I was building as a proof of concept for the
game. I had intended for there to be more levels, the ability to roam the map mostly freely,
and classes with differing stats, perhaps even a party, for the main character. What I was 
able to build was a very linear movement system, a character sheet with a level up button 
that worked mostly the way I wanted it to, and a fight mechanic that was pretty much just
rock-paper-scissors. 

Until I have a lot more free time this is where the project will stay unless some kind soul 
wishes to take up development and fix the things that I was struggling with. Who knows that 
Might even bee future me.
